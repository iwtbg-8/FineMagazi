        <h1 class="post-title">Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <p class="lead-paragraph">
            We are FineMagazi (https://finemagazi.com) and here, privacy matters. This Privacy Policy explains how sorting in the information we obtain when you visit our website.
        </p> 
        
        <section class="post-body">
            <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
            <p>At present, FineMagazi does not collect personal data directly from users, namely names, e-mail addresses, or payment details.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, like most websites, we might collect limited information automatically through:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cookies and analytic tools to understand traffic, improve the performance of the site, and monitor areas.</li>
                    <li>Third-party services (e.g., Google Search Console, Bing Webmaster Tools, and Google AdSense once implemented).</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>2. Information Use</h2>
            <p>The limited data that is collected via cookies or by the third-party tools may be used for the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tracking and analyzing traffic on the website.</li>
                    <li>Improving user experience and site performance.</li>
                    <li>Showing personalized or non-personalized ads (when AdSense is activated).</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>3. Cookies</h2>
            <p>We operate cookies and similar techs to deliver service-enhancing experiences to our users. You can choose to disable cookies through your browser. Some parts of the site could become either inaccessible or exhibit flawed functionality if cookies are disabled.</p>

            <h2>4. Third-party services</h2>
            <p>Our website might use the following services:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Google Search Console & Bing Webmaster Tools:</b> In monitoring site health and site traffic.</li>
                    <li><b>Google AdSense (Future):</b> To show advertisements which may use cookies and collect anonymized user behavior for ad personalization.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Data collected by these third-parties will be governed by their respective privacy policies.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacy/privacystatement?msockid=23abf4d493326a043095e29392776bba">Bing/Microsoft Privacy Statement</a></li>
                </ul>

            <h2>5. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
            <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>GDPR (EU/EEA): </b>Access, correction, deletion, or restriction of use of your personal data.</li>
                    <li><b>CCPA (California, USA): </b>Right to know what data is collected, request deletion, and opt-out of sale of personal data.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Considering that FineMagazi does not collect personal data directly, these rights would mostly apply to third-party tools (for instance, Google).</p>

            <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>The FineMagazi site does not knowingly collect information from children younger than 13 years (or 16 years in the EU) in size.</p>

            <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We are taking reasonable measures to protect our site and its data against unauthorized access.</p>

            <h2>8. Policy Changes</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most recent version shall always be published on this page with the latest date of application.</p>
            
            <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please write to us at:</p>
